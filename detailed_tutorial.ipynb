      "Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) is a tumor-suppressor protein that induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal/immortalized cells. The cancer-specific proapoptotic action of Par-4 is encoded in its centrally located SAC domain. We report here the characterization of a novel mouse model with ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain. Although SAC transgenic mice displayed normal development and life span, they were resistant to the growth of spontaneous, as well as oncogene-induced, autochthonous tumors. Resistance to tumorigenesis was linked to inhibition of nuclear factor-KB activity and induction of apoptosis by the SAC domain. Collectively, our findings provide genetic evidence that the SAC domain of Par-4 confers cancer resistance in transgenic mice without compromising normal viability or aging, and may have therapeutic significance.

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4), the product of the proapoptotic gene par-4, was first identified in prostate cancer cells that were induced to undergo apoptosis (1). Par-4 is a leucine zipper domain protein that is widely expressed in diverse normal and cancerous cell types and tissues (2, 3). Endogenous Par-4 itself does not cause apoptosis, yet it is essential for apoptosis induced by a variety of exogenous insults (2, 3). On the other hand, ectopic Par-4 overexpression is by itself sufficient to induce apoptosis in most cancer cells, but not in normal or immortalized cells (4). This cancer-selective apoptotic action of Par-4 does not require the leucine zipper domain, which is present at its carboxy terminus (4). In fact, the proapoptotic function of Par-4 is localized in its central core SAC domain (i.e., amino acids 137–195). Neither p53 nor PTEN are directly required for apoptosis by Par-4 or the SAC domain, and this apoptotic action is not inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL overexpression (4, 5). Moreover, adenoviral transduction of either Par-4 or the SAC domain into s.c. tumors grown in the flanks of nude mice results in rapid inhibition of tumor growth (ref. 5; Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Apoptosis of cancer cells by Par-4 requires phosphorylation of the T155 residue and nuclear translocation of Par-4 (6). Cancer cells that are resistant to nuclear translocation of Par-4 are resistant to apoptosis by Par-4 (4, 6). Nuclear translocation of Par-4 is essential for inhibition of pro-cell survival nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activity (4–6). Remarkably, the SAC domain translocates to the nucleus in all cell types, regardless of whether they are normal, immortalized, or cancer cells, yet it is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of the T155 residue only in cancer cells (6). This selective activation of Par-4 and the SAC domain in cancer cells is due to the higher PKA activity in cancer cells relative to their counterpart normal cells (6).\n",
      "\n",
      "Par-4 knockout mice develop spontaneous tumors in various tissues and show an increased incidence of chemical or hormone-inducible tumors of the bladder and endometrium (7). The par-4 (PAWR) gene has been mapped to human chromosome 12q21 (8). Although a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the SAC domain of par-4 gene has been reported in endometrial tumors (9), such mutations have not been reported thus far in most other cancers. However, there are several other more prominent mechanisms at play in cancer cells that result in suppression of Par-4 expression; for instance, methylation as in endometrial tumors (9), methylation-independent mechanisms as in renal cell carcinoma (10), or posttranslational modification and inactivation of Par-4 protein via binding and phosphorylation by the cell survival kinase Akt1 as in prostate cancer (11). Our recent studies indicate that activated Akt1 binds to Par-4 via its leucine zipper domain, and then phosphorylates Par-4, thereby rendering it a substrate for the chaperone 14-3-3 (11). The interaction with 14-3-3 results in sequestration of Par-4 in the cytoplasm, thus isolating Par-4 from its nuclear targets (11). By contrast, the SAC domain, which lacks the leucine zipper sequence of Par-4, neither binds to Akt1 nor is it phosphorylated/inactivated by Akt1. Consequently, the SAC domain, which represents the minimal functional proapoptotic unit of Par-4 that selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, is an ideal candidate for molecular therapy. The present study was undertaken to determine whether sustained and ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain is tolerated by normal tissues over the entire life span in mice, and whether the physiologic levels of transgenic SAC attained in various tissues were adequate for a tumor-suppressive function. We report that transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the SAC domain are normal with regard to development and life span, and are genetically resistant to the growth of autochthonous tumors.\n",

Mouse-tail DNA was isolated and genotyping was done using PCR-based screening assays as described (14). The F1 mice obtained from crosses between TRAMP and SAC-GFP or GFP transgenic mice were humanely killed at 26 to 30 weeks of age. For the aging study, the hemizygous transgenic mice were interbred to generate a cohort of transgene+/ and littermate/ mice, and followed until 28 months of age. Some mice had to be killed by euthanasia, as they showed a large palpable tumor, huddled posture, immobility, or an obviously moribund appearance. A full necropsy was done on all animals.

Three transgenic mouse founders were obtained for each construct, and the integrity of the transgene was confirmed by PCR, as shown in Fig. 1B. The founders were then crossed with B6C3F1 partners to expand the transgenic lines. An analysis of the genomic DNA derived from the transgenic and control mice by Southern hybridization showed the expected band in the SAC/36, SAC/35, and GFP lanes; the littermate control lane did not show these bands (Fig. 1B). The intensity of the band in the SAC/35 lane was stronger than that in the SAC/36 lane (Fig. 1B). Band intensity comparisons with copy number standards suggested that the SAC/36 mouse has three to four copies, and the SAC/35 mouse has six to eight copies of the SAC transgene; the GFP mouse has one to two copies of the GFP transgene (data not shown).

As seen in Fig. 2A, transfection with oncogenic Ras or cotransfection with oncogenic Ras and c-Myc resulted in significantly (P < 0.001) higher levels of spontaneous apoptosis in the MEFs from SAC transgenic mice relative to MEFs from GFP transgenic mice or from littermate control mice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we tested the susceptibility of the SAC MEFs to oncogenic transformation, by examining transformed colony (foci) formation in cell culture. The MEFs were transduced with adenoviral constructs for oncogenic Ras and c-Myc, or GFP for control. As seen in Fig. 2B, the oncogenes produced a significantly (P < 0.001) large number of foci in the MEFs from the GFP transgenic mice and littermate control mice relative to the very few foci observed for the MEFs derived from the SAC transgenic mice. Together, these findings suggest the SAC transgene is functional in the MEFs, as it produces apoptosis and prevents cellular transformation by the oncogenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the SAC domain induces apoptosis by inhibiting the pro-cell survival activity of NF-nB (4, 6), we did NF-nB reporter assays to determine basal and oncogenic Ras- and c-Myc–inducible NF-nB activity in MEFs isolated from the SAC, GFP, and littermate control mice. The frequency of transfection was similar in the SAC, GFP, and littermate control MEFs, as judged by GFP expression or h-galactosidase activity after transfection with GFP expression plasmid or h-galactosidase expression plasmid, respectively (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 2C, basal NF-nB activity was similar among the SAC, GFP, and control MEFs. However, upon introduction of oncogenic Ras and c-Myc, the GFP and control MEFs, but not the SAC MEFs, showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in NF-nB activity (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that the SAC domain inhibited NF-nB activity induced by oncogenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine whether inhibition of oncogene-inducible NF-nB activity was sufficient to induce apoptosis, we tested the effect of a known inhibitor of NF-nB, InB-SR, on apoptosis in oncogene-expressing MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2D, littermate control MEFs cotransfected with the InB-SR and oncogenic Ras plus c-Myc underwent apoptosis. In contrast, wild-type MEFs cotransfected with oncogenic Ras and c-Myc in the presence of GFP did not undergo apoptosis (Fig. 2D). As expected, InB-SR suppressed NF-nB activity in the littermate control MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, inhibition of NF-nB activity induces apoptosis of the oncogene-expressing cells.\n",

These lymphoma cells did not have a lymphoblastic appearance. Alternatively, spleen sections from SAC animals showed preserved splenic architecture with distinct red and white pulp zones (Fig. 3), with the white pulp areas showing preserved marginal zones. There was some variability in the size of white pulp zones, but the underlying architecture was preserved in all cases.\n",

      "SAC transgenic mice have increased resistance to oncogene-inducible prostate tumor growth. To determine whether the physiologic levels of the SAC domain that are well tolerated (i.e., did not alter the normal viability, growth, or life span) could inhibit the growth of aggressive autochthonous tumors, we crossed the SAC or GFP transgenic mice with tumor-prone TRAMP mice that produce transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (13). The genotypes of the offspring from crosses of the SAC transgenic mice with TRAMP mice were confirmed by PCR genotyping (data not shown) to identify the SAC+//TRAMP +/ or GFP +//TRAMP+/ mice; SAC//TRAMP+/ and SAC+//TRAMP/ animals were used as littermate controls. Prostate tumor progression was studied by H&E staining of paraffin-fixed prostate sections. Histopathology of the mouse prostates indicated that by 3 months of age, the majority (62.5–83.3%) of the GFP+//TRAMP +/ SAC//TRAMP+/ and control mice developed high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and 12% to 16% animals showed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Table 2; Fig. 4A, left). By 6 months, 100% of the GFP+//TRAMP+/ SAC//TRAMP +/ mice developed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Table 2; Fig. 4A, left).

Conversely, the SAC+//TRAMP +/ mice expressed the SAC transgene in normal cells of the prostate, but showed a loss of SAC domain expression within the PIN lesions and in all of the adenocarcinoma sections (Fig. 4A, right). As expected, the SAC +//TRAMP/ control mice continued to express the SAC transgene in the prostates at 3 or 6 months of age (Fig. 4A, right). These findings imply that expression of the SAC transgene must be down-modulated before adenocarcinoma development in the prostate. This observation was further substantiated by the finding that by age 12 months, 80% of the SAC+//TRAMP +/ mice developed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, the remaining 20% had only PIN lesions, and all tumors showed loss of SAC domain expression (data not shown).\n",

      "Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings of this study indicated that ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain of Par-4 is well tolerated in transgenic mice and does not interfere with the development, fertility, or life span of the animals. Most importantly, the physiologic levels of the SAC domain in the tissues are adequate to induce apoptosis and inhibit the development and progression of autochthonous tumors in the transgenic animals. Consistent with this observation, cells derived from the SAC transgenic mice grow normally in culture, but are resistant to oncogene-mediated cellular transformation. In fact, the SAC MEFs undergo apoptosis in the presence of oncogenes. These observations imply that the introduction of initiating lesions triggers the SAC domain to induce apoptosis and safeguard against transformation. The critical involvement of the SAC domain in preventing tumor growth in the transgenic mice was further reinforced by the finding that loss of SAC domain expression was associated with the ability of the SAC transgenic mice to produce autochthonous adenocarcinomas in the prostate. The SAC domain inhibits NF-nB DNA binding activity as judged by our electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). Inhibition of pro-cell survival NF-nB activity was identified as a mechanism underlying SAC domain–mediated apoptosis of oncogene-expressing cells. Thus, this study indicates the SAC domain is highly selective in inducing apoptosis to prevent transformation, as well as the subsequent development and progression of tumors in vivo. The SAC transgenic mouse is the first example of a cancer-resistant mouse that evades oncogene-mediated tumorigenesis by initiating apoptosis via the suppression of a defined pro-cell survival pathway. Par-4 is a tumor suppressor that is inactivated by mutation within the SAC domain (9), or by Akt1-mediated phosphorylation (11), or down-regulated (e.g., by hypermethylation) in human cancers (9, 10), and loss of Par-4 in knockout mice results in spontaneous tumors in diverse tissues (7). The SAC domain constitutes the effector domain for the Par-4 proapoptotic function (4, 6), and our present in vivo findings underscore the significance of the SAC domain in the tumor-suppressor function of Par-4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SAC domain is well tolerated and does not compromise fertility or life span in mice. Our previous studies had indicated that cancer cell lines, regardless of their sensitivity or resistance to Par-4, are usually sensitive to the apoptotic action of the SAC domain. On the other hand, normal or immortalized cell lines failed to undergo apoptosis with the SAC domain. Moreover, intratumoral injection of an adenovirus producing the SAC domain in s.c. tumor xenografts in nude mice caused rapid inhibition of tumor growth. In view of the limitations of the previous cell culture experiments, which tested apoptosis over a short-term period, and the fact that cell culture stress may differentially alter the response to apoptotic signals, we tested the tolerance and efficacy of the SAC module in animal models. Accordingly, transgenic mice that ubiquitously expressed the SAC transgene were generated to determine whether the mouse tissues tolerated the expression of the SAC transgene, and, importantly, whether at near-physiologic levels of in vivo expression the SAC domain maintained its apoptotic and tumor-suppressor potential. Moreover, due to the possibility that tumor suppressors may protect organisms from cancer early in life, but promote aging phenotypes, including late life cancer, in older organisms (20), we studied fertility and viability in the animals over their life span. Our studies indicated that the litter size and gender ratio were similar among the SAC and GFP transgenic mice, as well as the nontransgenic littermate control mice. The SAC transgenic mice developed and grew normally. The SAC and GFP transgenic mice maintained the corresponding transgene throughout their life span (data not shown), and the SAC transgenic mice lived a few months longer (P < 0.01) than the GFP transgenic mice or littermate control mice. The increase in survival observed in SAC transgenic mice may reflect the lower incidence of spontaneous tumors in these mice. However, the presence of tumors in older moribund mice does not necessarily imply that the tumors were the cause of death. Thus, fertility, viability, aging, and life span of the SAC transgenic mice were normal.\n",

      "Susceptibility to cancer is a quantitative genetic trait involving complex interactions among a large number of genes (21). Therefore, variation in the expression of alleles of tumor-suppressor genes may differentially dictate cancer susceptibility in different individuals (22–24). The precise effect of a modest increase in the activity of tumor-suppressor genes remains largely\n",

In contrast, other mouse models in which p53 activity is aberrantly increased by amino-terminal protein truncation show tumor resistance but premature aging (27, 28). Thus, aberrant expression of a transgene may inversely affect suppression of tumor growth and aging (27, 28). In this context, the cancer resistance and normal life span of the SAC transgenic mice are particularly noteworthy.\n",

      "The SAC transgene prevents oncogenic transformation. Coexpression of Par-4, or its SAC domain, and oncogenes induces apoptosis (4, 6, 16). This observation is supported by our previous studies that used transfection of cells, which stably expressed oncogenes, with either Par-4– or SAC domain-expression constructs. The ability of the SAC domain to induce apoptosis in oncogene-expressing cells was further explored by testing the functional role of the SAC transgene in cells derived from the SAC transgenic mice. MEFs derived from the SAC transgenic mice grow normally in culture and show a similar doubling time as the MEFs from GFP transgenic mice and littermate transgene-negative control mice (data not shown). However, unlike the control MEFs, the SAC MEFs failed to undergo transformation with oncogenic Ras and Myc. In fact, the introduction of oncogenic Ras and Myc caused apoptosis in the SAC MEFs, indicating that the endogenous level of the SAC domain was adequate to confer proapoptotic function and prevent oncogenic transformation. Moreover, consistent with previous findings, the expression of oncogenic Ras and/or c-Myc resulted in elevated PKA activity, which is necessary for activation of the SAC domain (data not shown).\n",

Several mechanisms, including inhibition of PKC by direct interaction with the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 (29) and nuclear inhibition of NF-nB transcription activity (16), have been proposed as the basis for Par-4 inhibition of NF-nB activity. However, recent studies indicate the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 is dispensable for its apoptotic action (4, 6, 30). Studies are currently under way to determine the mechanism by which NF-nB activity is inhibited by the SAC domain, which lacks the leucine zipper domain and primarily shows nuclear localization.\n",

We noted a high incidence of hepatocarcinomas in the liver and lymphomas in the spleen of aging GFP transgenic and littermate control mice, although none of the SAC transgenic mice showed tumors in the liver or spleen. This finding expands the range of the tumor tissues that may be targeted by the SAC domain to include hepatocarcinomas and hematopoietic tumors. As distinct pathways may be involved in the production of epithelial and hematopoietic tumors, this observation warrants further characterization of the tumors in the B6C3F1 mice and the precise mechanism of SAC-mediated tumor suppression. Importantly, several generations of the SAC transgenic mice were found to be similarly resistant to the growth of spontaneous tumors (data not shown), implying stable inheritance of the tumor-suppressor function of the SAC domain.\n",

      "SAC transgenic mice have increased resistance to prostate tumor growth. The TRAMP model provided the advantage of testing tumor suppression by the SAC domain in the absence of cellular p53 or Rb function, which is inhibited by the large T antigen of SV40. Our findings suggest the offspring expressing the SAC domain showed delayed development of PIN (high-grade PINs were more common in SAC/TRAMP + mice relative to SAC+/TRAMP+ mice) and were resistant to the development of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Importantly, the tumors in all of the 21.4% SAC+/TRAMP + mice that progressed to adenocarcinoma (see Table 2) showed loss of SAC transgene expression. This finding implies that the SAC transgene functioned as a tumor suppressor in the prostate tissue, and that progression to advanced disease required loss of its tumor-suppressor function. The mechanism of tumor suppression by the SAC domain involved apoptosis of the cells within the PIN lesions of the SAC+/TRAMP + mice. Our parallel cell culture studies confirmed that SAC domain induces apoptosis of the TRAMP-C1 cells. The BPH-1 cells derived from benign prostatic hyperplasia are, on the other hand, resistant to apoptosis by the SAC domain, but can be rendered sensitive to SAC-mediated apoptosis by introduction of the small t antigen, which together with the large T antigen causes malignant transformation of the TRAMP tumors. The mechanism of apoptosis by the SAC domain involved inhibition of NF-nB activity, activity in the TRAMP cells was sufficient to induce apoptosis. Collectively, our cell culture and animal experiments imply that the SAC module induces apoptosis within the benign lesions to avert progression to adenocarcinoma by a p53- and Rb-independent pathway that involves inhibition of NF-nB activity.\n",

      "The SAC module is an archetype cancer therapeutic agent. The SAC domain, which circumvents inhibition by activated Akt (as it lacks the Akt-binding leucine zipper domain of Par-4; ref. 11), provides an ideal molecule for the therapy of cancer. Strikingly, the SAC domain exemplifies an archetypical anticancer therapeutic agent, as it is well tolerated in vivo, does not compromise the normal tissue function or life span of the host, and at physiologically innocuous levels is potent enough to induce tumor suppression via apoptosis. Thus, the findings of the present study with the SAC transgenic mice have translational significance for the development and analysis of cancer therapeutics.\n",

      "Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) is a tumor-suppressor protein that induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal/immortalized cells. The cancer-specific proapoptotic action of Par-4 is encoded in its centrally located SAC domain. We report here the characterization of a novel mouse model with ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain. Although SAC transgenic mice displayed normal development and life span, they were resistant to the growth of spontaneous, as well as oncogene-induced, autochthonous tumors. Resistance to tumorigenesis was linked to inhibition of nuclear factor-KB activity and induction of apoptosis by the SAC domain. Collectively, our findings provide genetic evidence that the SAC domain of Par-4 confers cancer resistance in transgenic mice without compromising normal viability or aging, and may have therapeutic significance.

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Prostate apoptosis response-4(Par-4), the product of the proapoptotic gene par-4, was first identified in prostate cancer cells that were induced to undergo apoptosis (1). Par-4 is a leucine zipper domain protein that is widely expressed in diverse normal and cancerous cell types and tissues (2, 3). Endogenous Par-4 itself does not cause apoptosis, yet it is essential for apoptosis induced by a variety of exogenous insults (2, 3). On the other hand, ectopic Par-4 overexpression is by itself sufficient to induce apoptosis in most cancer cells, but not in normal or immortalized cells (4). This cancer-selective apoptotic action of Par-4 does not require the leucine zipper domain, which is present at its carboxy terminus (4). In fact, the proapoptotic function of Par-4 is localized in its central core SAC domain (i.e., amino acids 137–195). Neither p53 nor PTEN are directly required for apoptosis by Par-4 or the SAC domain, and this apoptotic action is not inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL overexpression (4, 5). Moreover, adenoviral transduction of either Par-4 or the SAC domain into s.c. tumors grown in the flanks of nude mice results in rapid inhibition of tumor growth (ref. 5; Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Apoptosis of cancer cells by Par-4 requires phosphorylation of the T155 residue and nuclear translocation of Par-4 (6). Cancer cells that are resistant to nuclear translocation of Par-4 are resistant to apoptosis by Par-4 (4, 6). Nuclear translocation of Par-4 is essential for inhibition of pro-cell survival nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activity (4–6). Remarkably, the SAC domain translocates to the nucleus in all cell types, regardless of whether they are normal, immortalized, or cancer cells, yet it is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of the T155 residue only in cancer cells (6). This selective activation of Par-4 and the SAC domain in cancer cells is due to the higher PKA activity in cancer cells relative to their counterpart normal cells (6).\n",
      "\n",
      "Par-4 knockout mice develop spontaneous tumors in various tissues and show an increased incidence of chemical or hormone-inducible tumors of the bladder and endometrium (7). The par-4 (PAWR) gene has been mapped to human chromosome 12q21 (8). Although a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the SAC domain of par-4 gene has been reported in endometrial tumors (9), such mutations have not been reported thus far in most other cancers. However, there are several other more prominent mechanisms at play in cancer cells that result in suppression of Par-4 expression; for instance, methylation as in endometrial tumors (9), methylation-independent mechanisms as in renal cell carcinoma (10), or posttranslational modification and inactivation of Par-4 protein via binding and phosphorylation by the cell survival kinase Akt1 as in prostate cancer (11). Our recent studies indicate that activated Akt1 binds to Par-4 via its leucine zipper domain, and then phosphorylates Par-4, thereby rendering it a substrate for the chaperone 14-3-3 (11). The interaction with 14-3-3 results in sequestration of Par-4 in the cytoplasm, thus isolating Par-4 from its nuclear targets (11). By contrast, the SAC domain, which lacks the leucine zipper sequence of Par-4, neither binds to Akt1 nor is it phosphorylated/inactivated by Akt1. Consequently, the SAC domain, which represents the minimal functional proapoptotic unit of Par-4 that selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, is an ideal candidate for molecular therapy. The present study was undertaken to determine whether sustained and ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain is tolerated by normal tissues over the entire life span in mice, and whether the physiologic levels of transgenic SAC attained in various tissues were adequate for a tumor-suppressive function. We report that transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the SAC domain are normal with regard to development and life span, and are genetically resistant to the growth of autochthonous tumors.\n",

The DNA fragment was cloned into EcoRI- and KpnI-digested peGFPN1 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and a shuttle plasmid pSACeGFP was generated. The plasmid pCA/SAC-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed by releasing the SAC-eGFP fragment from pSACeGFP by EcoRI (blunt-ended)-NotI (blunt-ended) and subcloned into the EcoRI (blunt-ended) site in pCAGGS vector (a generous gift from Jun-ichi Miyazaki, Division of Stem Cell Regulation Research, Osaka University, Japan; ref. 12). In the pCAGGS vector, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer and the chicken h-actin promoter sequence are located upstream of the MCS region. In addition, a rabbit h-globin polyadenylic acid sequence is located downstream from the MCS region (12). The plasmid pCA/GFP was constructed by releasing the eGFP fragment from peGFPN1 vector with EcoRI (blunt-ended)-NotI (blunt-ended) and subcloning it into the EcoRI (blunt-ended) site in pCAGGS vector. The resulting constructs, pCA/SAC-GFP (containing CMV enhancer-chicken h-actin promoter-SACeGFP followed by an intron) and pCA/GFP (containing CMV enhancer-chicken h-actin promoter-eGFP followed by an intron) were excised from vector sequences with SalI, purified, and injected into pronuclei of fertilized B6C3F1 embryos. All procedures were carried out by the University of Kentucky Transgenic Mouse Facility. The resulting offspring were screened for the presence of the transgene by PCR using DNA from tail clips to detect the CMV enhancer region of the transgene with the sense primer, 5′-CGTATGTTCCCATAG-TAACGC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CGTAGATGTACTGCCAAGTAGG-3′.

Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice (13) that express SV40 large Tantigen under the control of the prostate-specific probasin promoter and B6C3F1 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The hemizygous TRAMP female (100% C57BL6 background) and SAC or GFP male (50% C57BL6 and 50% C3H background) were mated. The F1 generation (75% C57BL6 and 25% C3H background) of transgenic males and the nontransgenic littermates were obtained in accordance with Mendelian ratios [TRAMP+/ /SAC+/ ]; [TRAMP+/ /SAC / ]; [TRAMP / /SAC+/ ] and [TRAMP+/ /GFP+/ ]. Mouse-tail DNA was isolated and genotyping was done using PCR-based screening assays as described (14). The F1 mice obtained from crosses between TRAMP and SAC-GFP or GFP transgenic mice were humanely killed at 26 to 30 weeks of age. For the aging study, the hemizygous transgenic mice were interbred to generate a cohort of transgene+/ and littermate / mice, and followed until 28 months of age. Some mice had to be killed by euthanasia, as they showed a large palpable tumor, huddled posture, immobility, or an obviously moribund appearance. A full necropsy was done on all animals. The primary tumors were excised and weighed. Liver, lung, spleen, kidney, intestine, and pelvic organs were collected, and portions were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathologic analysis or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.\n",

Transgenic mice were obtained by injecting the GFP or SAC-GFP expression construct (Fig. 1A) into fertilized oocytes from B6C3F1 hybrid mice. Three transgenic mouse founders were obtained for each construct, and the integrity of the transgene was confirmed by PCR, as shown in Fig. 1B. The founders were then crossed with B6C3F1 partners to expand the transgenic lines. An analysis of the genomic DNA derived from the transgenic and control mice by Southern hybridization showed the expected band in the SAC/36, SAC/35, and GFP lanes; the littermate control lane did not show these bands (Fig. 1B). The intensity of the band in the SAC/35 lane was stronger than that in the SAC/36 lane (Fig. 1B). Band intensity comparisons with copy number standards suggested that the SAC/36 mouse has three to four copies, and the SAC/35 mouse has six to eight copies of the SAC transgene; the GFP mouse has one to two copies of the GFP transgene (data not shown). There was a minor band present in the SAC/35 lane, but not in the SAC/36 lane (Fig. 1B); and longer exposure of the blot (not shown) confirmed integration of the transgene in distinct sites in SAC/35 and SAC/36 mice.\n",

As expression of oncogenic Ras and/or c-Myc leads to elevated PKA-driven activation of the proapoptotic potential of the SAC domain (6), we sought to analyze the functionality of the SAC transgene by testing MEFs from the transgenic mice or from littermate control mice for response to oncogenic Ras and c-Myc. As seen in Fig. 2A, transfection with oncogenic Ras or cotransfection with oncogenic Ras and c-Myc resulted in significantly (P < 0.001) higher levels of spontaneous apoptosis in the MEFs from SAC transgenic mice relative to MEFs from GFP transgenic mice or from littermate control mice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we tested the susceptibility of the SAC MEFs to oncogenic transformation, by examining transformed colony (foci) formation in cell culture. The MEFs were transduced with adenoviral constructs for oncogenic Ras and c-Myc, or GFP for control. As seen in Fig. 2B, the oncogenes produced a significantly (P < 0.001) large number of foci in the MEFs from the GFP transgenic mice and littermate control mice relative to the very few foci observed for the MEFs derived from the SAC transgenic mice. Together, these findings suggest the SAC transgene is functional in the MEFs, as it produces apoptosis and prevents cellular transformation by the oncogenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the SAC domain induces apoptosis by inhibiting the pro-cell survival activity of NF-nB (4, 6), we did NF-nB reporter assays to determine basal and oncogenic Ras- and c-Myc–inducible NF-nB activity in MEFs isolated from the SAC, GFP, and littermate control mice. The frequency of transfection was similar in the SAC, GFP, and littermate control MEFs, as judged by GFP expression or h-galactosidase activity after transfection with GFP expression plasmid or h-galactosidase expression plasmid, respectively (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 2C, basal NF-nB activity was similar among the SAC, GFP, and control MEFs. However, upon introduction of oncogenic Ras and c-Myc, the GFP and control MEFs, but not the SAC MEFs, showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in NF-nB activity (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that the SAC domain inhibited NF-nB activity induced by oncogenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine whether inhibition of oncogene-inducible NF-nB activity was sufficient to induce apoptosis, we tested the effect of a known inhibitor of NF-nB, InB-SR, on apoptosis in oncogene-expressing MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2D, littermate control MEFs cotransfected with the InB-SR and oncogenic Ras plus c-Myc underwent apoptosis. In contrast, wild-type MEFs cotransfected with oncogenic Ras and c-Myc in the presence of GFP did not undergo apoptosis (Fig. 2D). As expected, InB-SR suppressed NF-nB activity in the littermate control MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, inhibition of NF-nB activity induces apoptosis of the oncogene-expressing cells.\n",

The genotypes of the offspring from crosses of the SAC transgenic mice with TRAMP mice were confirmed by PCR genotyping (data not shown) to identify the SAC +/ /TRAMP +/ or GFP+/ /TRAMP+/ mice; SAC / /TRAMP+/ and SAC +/ /TRAMP / animals were used as littermate controls.

Conversely, the SAC +/ /TRAMP +/ mice expressed the SAC transgene in normal cells of the prostate, but showed a loss of SAC domain expression within the PIN lesions and in all of the adenocarcinoma sections (Fig. 4A, right). As expected, the SAC +/ /TRAMP / control mice continued to express the SAC transgene in the prostates at 3 or 6 months of age (Fig. 4A, right). These findings imply that expression of the SAC transgene must be down-modulated before adenocarcinoma development in the prostate. This observation was further substantiated by the finding that by age 12 months, 80% of the SAC +/ /TRAMP +/ mice developed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, the remaining 20% had only PIN lesions, and all tumors showed loss of SAC domain expression (data not shown).\n",

Transfection with Par-4, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells but not normal or immortalized cells, was used as control. TRAMP-C1 cells are transformed because they express both SV40 large T and small t oncoproteins. The BPH-1 cells express stably integrated large T oncoprotein and are, therefore, immortalized; BPH-1 cells rarely show spontaneous transformation but can be induced to undergo transformation at high frequency by ectopic expression of the small t oncoprotein. As seen in Fig. 5B, TRAMP-C1 cells readily underwent apoptosis after transfection with either the SAC domain or Par-4, but not with the GFP control construct. On the contrary, BPH-1 cells failed to undergo apoptosis upon transfection with the SAC domain or the Par-4 construct (Fig. 5B).\n",

From these data, we infer immortalized BPH-1 cells are resistant to apoptosis by the SAC domain, but coexpression of transforming small t oncoprotein renders them sensitive to apoptosis by the SAC domain.

      "\n",
      "The findings of this study indicated that ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain of Par-4 is well tolerated in transgenic mice and does not interfere with the development, fertility, or life span of the animals. Most importantly, the physiologic levels of the SAC domain in the tissues are adequate to induce apoptosis and inhibit the development and progression of autochthonous tumors in the transgenic animals. Consistent with this observation, cells derived from the SAC transgenic mice grow normally in culture, but are resistant to oncogene-mediated cellular transformation. In fact, the SAC MEFs undergo apoptosis in the presence of oncogenes. These observations imply that the introduction of initiating lesions triggers the SAC domain to induce apoptosis and safeguard against transformation. The critical involvement of the SAC domain in preventing tumor growth in the transgenic mice was further reinforced by the finding that loss of SAC domain expression was associated with the ability of the SAC transgenic mice to produce autochthonous adenocarcinomas in the prostate. The SAC domain inhibits NF-nB DNA binding activity as judged by our electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). Inhibition of pro-cell survival NF-nB activity was identified as a mechanism underlying SAC domain–mediated apoptosis of oncogene-expressing cells. Thus, this study indicates the SAC domain is highly selective in inducing apoptosis to prevent transformation, as well as the subsequent development and progression of tumors in vivo. The SAC transgenic mouse is the first example of a cancer-resistant mouse that evades oncogene-mediated tumorigenesis by initiating apoptosis via the suppression of a defined pro-cell survival pathway. Par-4 is a tumor suppressor that is inactivated by mutation within the SAC domain (9), or by Akt1-mediated phosphorylation (11), or down-regulated (e.g., by hypermethylation) in human cancers (9, 10), and loss of Par-4 in knockout mice results in spontaneous tumors in diverse tissues (7). The SAC domain constitutes the effector domain for the Par-4 proapoptotic function (4, 6), and our present in vivo findings underscore the significance of the SAC domain in the tumor-suppressor function of Par-4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SAC domain is well tolerated and does not compromise fertility or life span in mice. Our previous studies had indicated that cancer cell lines, regardless of their sensitivity or resistance to Par-4, are usually sensitive to the apoptotic action of the SAC domain. On the other hand, normal or immortalized cell lines failed to undergo apoptosis with the SAC domain. Moreover, intratumoral injection of an adenovirus producing the SAC domain in s.c. tumor xenografts in nude mice caused rapid inhibition of tumor growth. In view of the limitations of the previous cell culture experiments, which tested apoptosis over a short-term period, and the fact that cell culture stress may differentially alter the response to apoptotic signals, we tested the tolerance and efficacy of the SAC module in animal models. Accordingly, transgenic mice that ubiquitously expressed the SAC transgene were generated to determine whether the mouse tissues tolerated the expression of the SAC transgene, and, importantly, whether at near-physiologic levels of in vivo expression the SAC domain maintained its apoptotic and tumor-suppressor potential. Moreover, due to the possibility that tumor suppressors may protect organisms from cancer early in life, but promote aging phenotypes, including late life cancer, in older organisms (20), we studied fertility and viability in the animals over their life span. Our studies indicated that the litter size and gender ratio were similar among the SAC and GFP transgenic mice, as well as the nontransgenic littermate control mice. The SAC transgenic mice developed and grew normally. The SAC and GFP transgenic mice maintained the corresponding transgene throughout their life span (data not shown), and the SAC transgenic mice lived a few months longer (P < 0.01) than the GFP transgenic mice or littermate control mice. The increase in survival observed in SAC transgenic mice may reflect the lower incidence of spontaneous tumors in these mice. However, the presence of tumors in older moribund mice does not necessarily imply that the tumors were the cause of death. Thus, fertility, viability, aging, and life span of the SAC transgenic mice were normal.\n",

In contrast, other mouse models in which p53 activity is aberrantly increased by amino-terminal protein truncation show tumor resistance but premature aging (27, 28). Thus, aberrant expression of a transgene may inversely affect suppression of tumor growth and aging (27, 28).

Several mechanisms, including inhibition of PKC by direct interaction with the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 (29) and nuclear inhibition of NF-nB transcription activity (16), have been proposed as the basis for Par-4 inhibition of NF-nB activity. However, recent studies indicate the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 is dispensable for its apoptotic action (4, 6, 30). Studies are currently under way to determine the mechanism by which NF-nB activity is inhibited by the SAC domain, which lacks the leucine zipper domain and primarily shows nuclear localization.\n",

We noted a high incidence of hepatocarcinomas in the liver and lymphomas in the spleen of aging GFP transgenic and littermate control mice, although none of the SAC transgenic mice showed tumors in the liver or spleen. This finding expands the range of the tumor tissues that may be targeted by the SAC domain to include hepatocarcinomas and hematopoietic tumors. As distinct pathways may be involved in the production of epithelial and hematopoietic tumors, this observation warrants further characterization of the tumors in the B6C3F1 mice and the precise mechanism of SAC-mediated tumor suppression. Importantly, several generations of the SAC transgenic mice were found to be similarly resistant to the growth of spontaneous tumors (data not shown), implying stable inheritance of the tumor-suppressor function of the SAC domain.\n",

      "SAC transgenic mice have increased resistance to prostate tumor growth. The TRAMP model provided the advantage of testing tumor suppression by the SAC domain in the absence of cellular p53 or Rb function, which is inhibited by the large T antigen of SV40. Our findings suggest the offspring expressing the SAC domain showed delayed development of PIN (high-grade PINs were more common in SAC /TRAMP + mice relative to SAC +/TRAMP + mice) and were resistant to the development of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Importantly, the tumors in all of the 21.4% SAC +/TRAMP + mice that progressed to adenocarcinoma (see Table 2) showed loss of SAC transgene expression. This finding implies that the SAC transgene functioned as a tumor suppressor in the prostate tissue, and that progression to advanced disease required loss of its tumor-suppressor function. The mechanism of tumor suppression by the SAC domain involved apoptosis of the cells within the PIN lesions of the SAC +/ /TRAMP + mice. Our parallel cell culture studies confirmed that SAC domain induces apoptosis of the TRAMP-C1 cells. The BPH-1 cells derived from benign prostatic hyperplasia are, on the other hand, resistant to apoptosis by the SAC domain, but can be rendered sensitive to SAC-mediated apoptosis by introduction of the small t antigen, which together with the large T antigen causes malignant transformation of the TRAMP tumors. The mechanism of apoptosis by the SAC domain involved inhibition of NF-nB activity, and studies with the I-nB-SR indicated that inhibition of NF-nB activity in the TRAMP cells was sufficient to induce apoptosis. Collectively, our cell culture and animal experiments imply that the SAC module induces apoptosis within the benign lesions to avert progression to adenocarcinoma by a p53- and Rb-independent pathway that involves inhibition of NF-nB activity.\n",

      "The SAC module is an archetype cancer therapeutic agent. The SAC domain, which circumvents inhibition by activated Akt (as it lacks the Akt-binding leucine zipper domain of Par-4; ref. 11), provides an ideal molecule for the therapy of cancer. Strikingly, the SAC domain exemplifies an archetypical anticancer therapeutic agent, as it is well tolerated in vivo, does not compromise the normal tissue function or life span of the host, and at physiologically innocuous levels is potent enough to induce tumor suppression via apoptosis. Thus, the findings of the present study with the SAC transgenic mice have translational significance for the development and analysis of cancer therapeutics.\n",

      "Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) is a tumor-suppressor protein that induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal/immortalized cells. The cancer-specific proapoptotic action of Par-4 is encoded in its centrally located SAC domain. We report here the characterization of a novel mouse model with ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain. Although SAC transgenic mice displayed normal development and life span, they were resistant to the growth of spontaneous, as well as oncogene-induced, autochthonous tumors. Resistance to tumorigenesis was linked to inhibition of nuclear factor-KB activity and induction of apoptosis by the SAC domain. Collectively, our findings provide genetic evidence that the SAC domain of Par-4 confers cancer resistance in transgenic mice without compromising normal viability or aging, and may have therapeutic significance.

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Prostate apoptosis response-4(Par-4), the product of the proapoptotic gene par-4, was first identified in prostate cancer cells that were induced to undergo apoptosis (1). Par-4 is a leucine zipper domain protein that is widely expressed in diverse normal and cancerous cell types and tissues (2, 3). Endogenous Par-4 itself does not cause apoptosis, yet it is essential for apoptosis induced by a variety of exogenous insults (2, 3). On the other hand, ectopic Par-4 overexpression is by itself sufficient to induce apoptosis in most cancer cells, but not in normal or immortalized cells (4). This cancer-selective apoptotic action of Par-4 does not require the leucine zipper domain, which is present at its carboxy terminus (4). In fact, the proapoptotic function of Par-4 is localized in its central core SAC domain (i.e., amino acids 137–195). Neither p53 nor PTEN are directly required for apoptosis by Par-4 or the SAC domain, and this apoptotic action is not inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL overexpression (4, 5). Moreover, adenoviral transduction of either Par-4 or the SAC domain into s.c. tumors grown in the flanks of nude mice results in rapid inhibition of tumor growth (ref. 5; Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Apoptosis of cancer cells by Par-4 requires phosphorylation of the T155 residue and nuclear translocation of Par-4 (6). Cancer cells that are resistant to nuclear translocation of Par-4 are resistant to apoptosis by Par-4 (4, 6). Nuclear translocation of Par-4 is essential for inhibition of pro-cell survival nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activity (4–6). Remarkably, the SAC domain translocates to the nucleus in all cell types, regardless of whether they are normal, immortalized, or cancer cells, yet it is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of the T155 residue only in cancer cells (6). This selective activation of Par-4 and the SAC domain in cancer cells is due to the higher PKA activity in cancer cells relative to their counterpart normal cells (6).\n",
      "\n",
      "Par-4 knockout mice develop spontaneous tumors in various tissues and show an increased incidence of chemical or hormone-inducible tumors of the bladder and endometrium (7). The par-4 (PAWR) gene has been mapped to human chromosome 12q21 (8). Although a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the SAC domain of par-4 gene has been reported in endometrial tumors (9), such mutations have not been reported thus far in most other cancers. However, there are several other more prominent mechanisms at play in cancer cells that result in suppression of Par-4 expression; for instance, methylation as in endometrial tumors (9), methylation-independent mechanisms as in renal cell carcinoma (10), or posttranslational modification and inactivation of Par-4 protein via binding and phosphorylation by the cell survival kinase Akt1 as in prostate cancer (11). Our recent studies indicate that activated Akt1 binds to Par-4 via its leucine zipper domain, and then phosphorylates Par-4, thereby rendering it a substrate for the chaperone 14-3-3 (11). The interaction with 14-3-3 results in sequestration of Par-4 in the cytoplasm, thus isolating Par-4 from its nuclear targets (11). By contrast, the SAC domain, which lacks the leucine zipper sequence of Par-4, neither binds to Akt1 nor is it phosphorylated/inactivated by Akt1. Consequently, the SAC domain, which represents the minimal functional proapoptotic unit of Par-4 that selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, is an ideal candidate for molecular therapy. The present study was undertaken to determine whether sustained and ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain is tolerated by normal tissues over the entire life span in mice, and whether the physiologic levels of transgenic SAC attained in various tissues were adequate for a tumor-suppressive function. We report that transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the SAC domain are normal with regard to development and life span, and are genetically resistant to the growth of autochthonous tumors.\n",

The DNA fragment was cloned into EcoRI- and KpnI-digested peGFPN1 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and a shuttle plasmid pSACeGFP was generated. The plasmid pCA/SAC-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed by releasing the SAC-eGFP fragment from pSACeGFP by EcoRI (blunt-ended)-NotI (blunt-ended) and subcloned into the EcoRI (blunt-ended) site in pCAGGS vector (a generous gift from Jun-ichi Miyazaki, Division of Stem Cell Regulation Research, Osaka University, Japan; ref. 12). In the pCAGGS vector, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer and the chicken h-actin promoter sequence are located upstream of the MCS region. In addition, a rabbit h-globin polyadenylic acid sequence is located downstream from the MCS region (12). The plasmid pCA/GFP was constructed by releasing the eGFP fragment from peGFPN1 vector with EcoRI (blunt-ended)-NotI (blunt-ended) and subcloning it into the EcoRI (blunt-ended) site in pCAGGS vector. The resulting constructs, pCA/SAC-GFP (containing CMV enhancer-chicken h-actin promoter-SACeGFP followed by an intron) and pCA/GFP (containing CMV enhancer-chicken h-actin promoter-eGFP followed by an intron) were excised from vector sequences with SalI, purified, and injected into pronuclei of fertilized B6C3F1 embryos. All procedures were carried out by the University of Kentucky Transgenic Mouse Facility. The resulting offspring were screened for the presence of the transgene by PCR using DNA from tail clips to detect the CMV enhancer region of the transgene with the sense primer, 5′-CGTATGTTCCCATAG-TAACGC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CGTAGATGTACTGCCAAGTAGG-3′.

Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice (13) that express SV40 large Tantigen under the control of the prostate-specific probasin promoter and B6C3F1 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The hemizygous TRAMP female (100% C57BL6 background) and SAC or GFP male (50% C57BL6 and 50% C3H background) were mated. The F1 generation (75% C57BL6 and 25% C3H background) of transgenic males and the nontransgenic littermates were obtained in accordance with Mendelian ratios [TRAMP+/ /SAC+/ ]; [TRAMP+/ /SAC / ]; [TRAMP / /SAC+/ ] and [TRAMP+/ /GFP+/ ]. Mouse-tail DNA was isolated and genotyping was done using PCR-based screening assays as described (14). The F1 mice obtained from crosses between TRAMP and SAC-GFP or GFP transgenic mice were humanely killed at 26 to 30 weeks of age. For the aging study, the hemizygous transgenic mice were interbred to generate a cohort of transgene+/ and littermate / mice, and followed until 28 months of age. Some mice had to be killed by euthanasia, as they showed a large palpable tumor, huddled posture, immobility, or an obviously moribund appearance. A full necropsy was done on all animals. The primary tumors were excised and weighed.

Amplified fragments were ligated into the KpnI site of pShuttle-CMV shuttle plasmid vector. The linearized shuttle vector was cotransformed into BJ5183 bacteria with the pAdEasy-1 viral DNA plasmid. The recombinant adenoviral plasmid DNA was isolated, linearized with PacI, and transfected into AD-293 cells for adenoviral packaging and amplification. H-Ras and c-Myc adenoviruses were obtained from Joe Nevins (Duke Medical School, Durham, NC), and the GFP and mutant InBa (InBa-super repressor, InB-SR) adenoviruses were from Albert Baldwin (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The serine-32 and serine-36 phosphorylation sites are mutated in InBa-SR, making it both resistant to phosphorylation by IKK (InB kinase) and impervious to subsequent degradation; InB-SR therefore functions as an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway (5).\n",

Transgenic mice were obtained by injecting the GFP or SAC-GFP expression construct (Fig. 1A) into fertilized oocytes from B6C3F1 hybrid mice. Three transgenic mouse founders were obtained for each construct, and the integrity of the transgene was confirmed by PCR, as shown in Fig. 1B. The founders were then crossed with B6C3F1 partners to expand the transgenic lines. An analysis of the genomic DNA derived from the transgenic and control mice by Southern hybridization showed the expected band in the SAC/36, SAC/35, and GFP lanes; the littermate control lane did not show these bands (Fig. 1B). The intensity of the band in the SAC/35 lane was stronger than that in the SAC/36 lane (Fig. 1B). Band intensity comparisons with copy number standards suggested that the SAC/36 mouse has three to four copies, and the SAC/35 mouse has six to eight copies of the SAC transgene; the GFP mouse has one to two copies of the GFP transgene (data not shown). There was a minor band present in the SAC/35 lane, but not in the SAC/36 lane (Fig. 1B); and longer exposure of the blot (not shown) confirmed integration of the transgene in distinct sites in SAC/35 and SAC/36 mice.\n",

Consistent with this observation, a T155A mutant of the SAC domain failed to induce apoptosis in the Ras-transformed cells (6). As expression of oncogenic Ras and/or c-Myc leads to elevated PKA-driven activation of the proapoptotic potential of the SAC domain (6), we sought to analyze the functionality of the SAC transgene by testing MEFs from the transgenic mice or from littermate control mice for response to oncogenic Ras and c-Myc. As seen in Fig. 2A, transfection with oncogenic Ras or cotransfection with oncogenic Ras and c-Myc resulted in significantly (P < 0.001) higher levels of spontaneous apoptosis in the MEFs from SAC transgenic mice relative to MEFs from GFP transgenic mice or from littermate control mice.\n",

The frequency of transfection was similar in the SAC, GFP, and littermate control MEFs, as judged by GFP expression or h-galactosidase activity after transfection with GFP expression plasmid or h-galactosidase expression plasmid, respectively (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 2C, basal NF-nB activity was similar among the SAC, GFP, and control MEFs. However, upon introduction of oncogenic Ras and c-Myc, the GFP and control MEFs, but not the SAC MEFs, showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in NF-nB activity (Fig. 2C).

As expected, the SAC +/ /TRAMP / control mice continued to express the SAC transgene in the prostates at 3 or 6 months of age (Fig. 4A, right).

Transfection with Par-4, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells but not normal or immortalized cells, was used as control. TRAMP-C1 cells are transformed because they express both SV40 large T and small t oncoproteins. The BPH-1 cells express stably integrated large T oncoprotein and are, therefore, immortalized; BPH-1 cells rarely show spontaneous transformation but can be induced to undergo transformation at high frequency by ectopic expression of the small t oncoprotein. As seen in Fig. 5B, TRAMP-C1 cells readily underwent apoptosis after transfection with either the SAC domain or Par-4, but not with the GFP control construct. On the contrary, BPH-1 cells failed to undergo apoptosis upon transfection with the SAC domain or the Par-4 construct (Fig. 5B).\n",

From these data, we infer immortalized BPH-1 cells are resistant to apoptosis by the SAC domain, but coexpression of transforming small t oncoprotein renders them sensitive to apoptosis by the SAC domain.

      "\n",
      "The findings of this study indicated that ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain of Par-4 is well tolerated in transgenic mice and does not interfere with the development, fertility, or life span of the animals. Most importantly, the physiologic levels of the SAC domain in the tissues are adequate to induce apoptosis and inhibit the development and progression of autochthonous tumors in the transgenic animals. Consistent with this observation, cells derived from the SAC transgenic mice grow normally in culture, but are resistant to oncogene-mediated cellular transformation. In fact, the SAC MEFs undergo apoptosis in the presence of oncogenes. These observations imply that the introduction of initiating lesions triggers the SAC domain to induce apoptosis and safeguard against transformation. The critical involvement of the SAC domain in preventing tumor growth in the transgenic mice was further reinforced by the finding that loss of SAC domain expression was associated with the ability of the SAC transgenic mice to produce autochthonous adenocarcinomas in the prostate. The SAC domain inhibits NF-nB DNA binding activity as judged by our electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). Inhibition of pro-cell survival NF-nB activity was identified as a mechanism underlying SAC domain–mediated apoptosis of oncogene-expressing cells. Thus, this study indicates the SAC domain is highly selective in inducing apoptosis to prevent transformation, as well as the subsequent development and progression of tumors in vivo. The SAC transgenic mouse is the first example of a cancer-resistant mouse that evades oncogene-mediated tumorigenesis by initiating apoptosis via the suppression of a defined pro-cell survival pathway. Par-4 is a tumor suppressor that is inactivated by mutation within the SAC domain (9), or by Akt1-mediated phosphorylation (11), or down-regulated (e.g., by hypermethylation) in human cancers (9, 10), and loss of Par-4 in knockout mice results in spontaneous tumors in diverse tissues (7). The SAC domain constitutes the effector domain for the Par-4 proapoptotic function (4, 6), and our present in vivo findings underscore the significance of the SAC domain in the tumor-suppressor function of Par-4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SAC domain is well tolerated and does not compromise fertility or life span in mice. Our previous studies had indicated that cancer cell lines, regardless of their sensitivity or resistance to Par-4, are usually sensitive to the apoptotic action of the SAC domain. On the other hand, normal or immortalized cell lines failed to undergo apoptosis with the SAC domain. Moreover, intratumoral injection of an adenovirus producing the SAC domain in s.c. tumor xenografts in nude mice caused rapid inhibition of tumor growth. In view of the limitations of the previous cell culture experiments, which tested apoptosis over a short-term period, and the fact that cell culture stress may differentially alter the response to apoptotic signals, we tested the tolerance and efficacy of the SAC module in animal models. Accordingly, transgenic mice that ubiquitously expressed the SAC transgene were generated to determine whether the mouse tissues tolerated the expression of the SAC transgene, and, importantly, whether at near-physiologic levels of in vivo expression the SAC domain maintained its apoptotic and tumor-suppressor potential. Moreover, due to the possibility that tumor suppressors may protect organisms from cancer early in life, but promote aging phenotypes, including late life cancer, in older organisms (20), we studied fertility and viability in the animals over their life span. Our studies indicated that the litter size and gender ratio were similar among the SAC and GFP transgenic mice, as well as the nontransgenic littermate control mice. The SAC transgenic mice developed and grew normally. The SAC and GFP transgenic mice maintained the corresponding transgene throughout their life span (data not shown), and the SAC transgenic mice lived a few months longer (P < 0.01) than the GFP transgenic mice or littermate control mice. The increase in survival observed in SAC transgenic mice may reflect the lower incidence of spontaneous tumors in these mice. However, the presence of tumors in older moribund mice does not necessarily imply that the tumors were the cause of death. Thus, fertility, viability, aging, and life span of the SAC transgenic mice were normal.\n",

In contrast, other mouse models in which p53 activity is aberrantly increased by amino-terminal protein truncation show tumor resistance but premature aging (27, 28). Thus, aberrant expression of a transgene may inversely affect suppression of tumor growth and aging (27, 28).

Several mechanisms, including inhibition of PKC by direct interaction with the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 (29) and nuclear inhibition of NF-nB transcription activity (16), have been proposed as the basis for Par-4 inhibition of NF-nB activity. However, recent studies indicate the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 is dispensable for its apoptotic action (4, 6, 30).

We noted a high incidence of hepatocarcinomas in the liver and lymphomas in the spleen of aging GFP transgenic and littermate control mice, although none of the SAC transgenic mice showed tumors in the liver or spleen. This finding expands the range of the tumor tissues that may be targeted by the SAC domain to include hepatocarcinomas and hematopoietic tumors. As distinct pathways may be involved in the production of epithelial and hematopoietic tumors, this observation warrants further characterization of the tumors in the B6C3F1 mice and the precise mechanism of SAC-mediated tumor suppression. Importantly, several generations of the SAC transgenic mice were found to be similarly resistant to the growth of spontaneous tumors (data not shown), implying stable inheritance of the tumor-suppressor function of the SAC domain.\n",

      "SAC transgenic mice have increased resistance to prostate tumor growth. The TRAMP model provided the advantage of testing tumor suppression by the SAC domain in the absence of cellular p53 or Rb function, which is inhibited by the large T antigen of SV40. Our findings suggest the offspring expressing the SAC domain showed delayed development of PIN (high-grade PINs were more common in SAC /TRAMP + mice relative to SAC +/TRAMP + mice) and were resistant to the development of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Importantly, the tumors in all of the 21.4% SAC +/TRAMP + mice that progressed to adenocarcinoma (see Table 2) showed loss of SAC transgene expression. This finding implies that the SAC transgene functioned as a tumor suppressor in the prostate tissue, and that progression to advanced disease required loss of its tumor-suppressor function. The mechanism of tumor suppression by the SAC domain involved apoptosis of the cells within the PIN lesions of the SAC +/ /TRAMP + mice. Our parallel cell culture studies confirmed that SAC domain induces apoptosis of the TRAMP-C1 cells. The BPH-1 cells derived from benign prostatic hyperplasia are, on the other hand, resistant to apoptosis by the SAC domain, but can be rendered sensitive to SAC-mediated apoptosis by introduction of the small t antigen, which together with the large T antigen causes malignant transformation of the TRAMP tumors. The mechanism of apoptosis by the SAC domain involved inhibition of NF-nB activity, and studies with the I-nB-SR indicated that inhibition of NF-nB activity in the TRAMP cells was sufficient to induce apoptosis. Collectively, our cell culture and animal experiments imply that the SAC module induces apoptosis within the benign lesions to avert progression to adenocarcinoma by a p53- and Rb-independent pathway that involves inhibition of NF-nB activity.\n",

      "The SAC module is an archetype cancer therapeutic agent. The SAC domain, which circumvents inhibition by activated Akt (as it lacks the Akt-binding leucine zipper domain of Par-4; ref. 11), provides an ideal molecule for the therapy of cancer. Strikingly, the SAC domain exemplifies an archetypical anticancer therapeutic agent, as it is well tolerated in vivo, does not compromise the normal tissue function or life span of the host, and at physiologically innocuous levels is potent enough to induce tumor suppression via apoptosis. Thus, the findings of the present study with the SAC transgenic mice have translational significance for the development and analysis of cancer therapeutics.\n",

      "Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) is a tumor-suppressor protein that induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal/immortalized cells. The cancer-specific proapoptotic action of Par-4 is encoded in its centrally located SAC domain. We report here the characterization of a novel mouse model with ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain. Although SAC transgenic mice displayed normal development and life span, they were resistant to the growth of spontaneous, as well as oncogene-induced, autochthonous tumors. Resistance to tumorigenesis was linked to inhibition of nuclear factor-KB activity and induction of apoptosis by the SAC domain. Collectively, our findings provide genetic evidence that the SAC domain of Par-4 confers cancer resistance in transgenic mice without compromising normal viability or aging, and may have therapeutic significance. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9276–85]\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Prostate apoptosis response-4(Par-4), the product of the proapoptotic gene par-4, was first identified in prostate cancer cells that were induced to undergo apoptosis (1). Par-4 is a leucine zipper domain protein that is widely expressed in diverse normal and cancerous cell types and tissues (2, 3). Endogenous Par-4 itself does not cause apoptosis, yet it is essential for apoptosis induced by a variety of exogenous insults (2, 3). On the other hand, ectopic Par-4 overexpression is by itself sufficient to induce apoptosis in most cancer cells, but not in normal or immortalized cells (4). This cancer-selective apoptotic action of Par-4 does not require the leucine zipper domain, which is present at its carboxy terminus (4). In fact, the proapoptotic function of Par-4 is localized in its central core SAC domain (i.e., amino acids 137–195). Neither p53 nor PTEN are directly required for apoptosis by Par-4 or the SAC domain, and this apoptotic action is not inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL overexpression (4, 5). Moreover, adenoviral transduction of either Par-4 or the SAC domain into s.c. tumors grown in the flanks of nude mice results in rapid inhibition of tumor growth (ref. 5; Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Apoptosis of cancer cells by Par-4 requires phosphorylation of the T155 residue and nuclear translocation of Par-4 (6). Cancer cells that are resistant to nuclear translocation of Par-4 are resistant to apoptosis by Par-4 (4, 6). Nuclear translocation of Par-4 is essential for inhibition of pro-cell survival nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activity (4–6). Remarkably, the SAC domain translocates to the nucleus in all cell types, regardless of whether they are normal, immortalized, or cancer cells, yet it is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of the T155 residue only in cancer cells (6). This selective activation of Par-4 and the SAC domain in cancer cells is due to the higher PKA activity in cancer cells relative to their counterpart normal cells (6).\n",
      "\n",
      "Par-4 knockout mice develop spontaneous tumors in various tissues and show an increased incidence of chemical or hormone-inducible tumors of the bladder and endometrium (7). The par-4 (PAWR) gene has been mapped to human chromosome 12q21 (8). Although a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the SAC domain of par-4 gene has been reported in endometrial tumors (9), such mutations have not been reported thus far in most other cancers. However, there are several other more prominent mechanisms at play in cancer cells that result in suppression of Par-4 expression; for instance, methylation as in endometrial tumors (9), methylation-independent mechanisms as in renal cell carcinoma (10), or posttranslational modification and inactivation of Par-4 protein via binding and phosphorylation by the cell survival kinase Akt1 as in prostate cancer (11). Our recent studies indicate that activated Akt1 binds to Par-4 via its leucine zipper domain, and then phosphorylates Par-4, thereby rendering it a substrate for the chaperone 14-3-3 (11). The interaction with 14-3-3 results in sequestration of Par-4 in the cytoplasm, thus isolating Par-4 from its nuclear targets (11). By contrast, the SAC domain, which lacks the leucine zipper sequence of Par-4, neither binds to Akt1 nor is it phosphorylated/inactivated by Akt1. Consequently, the SAC domain, which represents the minimal functional proapoptotic unit of Par-4 that selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, is an ideal candidate for molecular therapy. The present study was undertaken to determine whether sustained and ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain is tolerated by normal tissues over the entire life span in mice, and whether the physiologic levels of transgenic SAC attained in various tissues were adequate for a tumor-suppressive function. We report that transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the SAC domain are normal with regard to development and life span, and are genetically resistant to the growth of autochthonous tumors.\n",

The DNA fragment was cloned into EcoRI- and KpnI-digested peGFPN1 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and a shuttle plasmid pSACeGFP was generated. The plasmid pCA/SAC-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed by releasing the SAC-eGFP fragment from pSACeGFP by EcoRI (blunt-ended)-NotI (blunt-ended) and subcloned into the EcoRI (blunt-ended) site in pCAGGS vector (a generous gift from Jun-ichi Miyazaki, Division of Stem Cell Regulation Research, Osaka University, Japan; ref. 12). In the pCAGGS vector, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer and the chicken h-actin promoter sequence are located upstream of the MCS region. In addition, a rabbit h-globin polyadenylic acid sequence is located downstream from the MCS region (12). The plasmid pCA/GFP was constructed by releasing the eGFP fragment from peGFPN1 vector with EcoRI (blunt-ended)-NotI (blunt-ended) and subcloning it into the EcoRI (blunt-ended) site in pCAGGS vector. The resulting constructs, pCA/SAC-GFP (containing CMV enhancer-chicken h-actin promoter-SACeGFP followed by an intron) and pCA/GFP (containing CMV enhancer-chicken h-actin promoter-eGFP followed by an intron) were excised from vector sequences with SalI, purified, and injected into pronuclei of fertilized B6C3F1 embryos. All procedures were carried out by the University of Kentucky Transgenic Mouse Facility. The resulting offspring were screened for the presence of the transgene by PCR using DNA from tail clips to detect the CMV enhancer region of the transgene with the sense primer, 5′-CGTATGTTCCCATAG-TAACGC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CGTAGATGTACTGCCAAGTAGG-3′.

Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice (13) that express SV40 large Tantigen under the control of the prostate-specific probasin promoter and B6C3F1 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The hemizygous TRAMP female (100% C57BL6 background) and SAC or GFP male (50% C57BL6 and 50% C3H background) were mated. The F1 generation (75% C57BL6 and 25% C3H background) of transgenic males and the nontransgenic littermates were obtained in accordance with Mendelian ratios [TRAMP+/ /SAC+/ ]; [TRAMP+/ /SAC / ]; [TRAMP / /SAC+/ ] and [TRAMP+/ /GFP+/ ]. Mouse-tail DNA was isolated and genotyping was done using PCR-based screening assays as described (14). The F1 mice obtained from crosses between TRAMP and SAC-GFP or GFP transgenic mice were humanely killed at 26 to 30 weeks of age. For the aging study, the hemizygous transgenic mice were interbred to generate a cohort of transgene+/ and littermate / mice, and followed until 28 months of age. Some mice had to be killed by euthanasia, as they showed a large palpable tumor, huddled posture, immobility, or an obviously moribund appearance. A full necropsy was done on all animals. The primary tumors were excised and weighed. Liver, lung, spleen, kidney, intestine, and pelvic organs were collected, and portions were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathologic analysis or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.\n",

Amplified fragments were ligated into the KpnI site of pShuttle-CMV shuttle plasmid vector. The linearized shuttle vector was cotransformed into BJ5183 bacteria with the pAdEasy-1 viral DNA plasmid. The recombinant adenoviral plasmid DNA was isolated, linearized with PacI, and transfected into AD-293 cells for adenoviral packaging and amplification. H-Ras and c-Myc adenoviruses were obtained from Joe Nevins (Duke Medical School, Durham, NC), and the GFP and mutant InBa (InBa-super repressor, InB-SR) adenoviruses were from Albert Baldwin (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The serine-32 and serine-36 phosphorylation sites are mutated in InBa-SR, making it both resistant to phosphorylation by IKK (InB kinase) and impervious to subsequent degradation; InB-SR therefore functions as an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway (5).\n",

      "SAC transgenic mice show ubiquitous expression of the SAC transgene and normal fertility, viability, and aging. Transgenic mice were obtained by injecting the GFP or SAC-GFP expression construct (Fig. 1A) into fertilized oocytes from B6C3F1 hybrid mice. Three transgenic mouse founders were obtained for each construct, and the integrity of the transgene was confirmed by PCR, as shown in Fig. 1B. The founders were then crossed with B6C3F1 partners to expand the transgenic lines. An analysis of the genomic DNA derived from the transgenic and control mice by Southern hybridization showed the expected band in the SAC/36, SAC/35, and GFP lanes; the littermate control lane did not show these bands (Fig. 1B). The intensity of the band in the SAC/35 lane was stronger than that in the SAC/36 lane (Fig. 1B). Band intensity comparisons with copy number standards suggested that the SAC/36 mouse has three to four copies, and the SAC/35 mouse has six to eight copies of the SAC transgene; the GFP mouse has one to two copies of the GFP transgene (data not shown). There was a minor band present in the SAC/35 lane, but not in the SAC/36 lane (Fig. 1B); and longer exposure of the blot (not shown) confirmed integration of the transgene in distinct sites in SAC/35 and SAC/36 mice.\n",

Consistent with this observation, a T155A mutant of the SAC domain failed to induce apoptosis in the Ras-transformed cells (6). As expression of oncogenic Ras and/or c-Myc leads to elevated PKA-driven activation of the proapoptotic potential of the SAC domain (6), we sought to analyze the functionality of the SAC transgene by testing MEFs from the transgenic mice or from littermate control mice for response to oncogenic Ras and c-Myc. As seen in Fig. 2A, transfection with oncogenic Ras or cotransfection with oncogenic Ras and c-Myc resulted in significantly (P < 0.001) higher levels of spontaneous apoptosis in the MEFs from SAC transgenic mice relative to MEFs from GFP transgenic mice or from littermate control mice.\n",

As seen in Fig. 2B, the oncogenes produced a significantly (P < 0.001) large number of foci in the MEFs from the GFP transgenic mice and littermate control mice relative to the very few foci observed for the MEFs derived from the SAC transgenic mice. Together, these findings suggest the SAC transgene is functional in the MEFs, as it produces apoptosis and prevents cellular transformation by the oncogenes.\n",

      "Because the SAC domain induces apoptosis by inhibiting the pro-cell survival activity of NF-nB (4, 6), we did NF-nB reporter assays to determine basal and oncogenic Ras- and c-Myc–inducible NF-nB activity in MEFs isolated from the SAC, GFP, and littermate control mice. The frequency of transfection was similar in the SAC, GFP, and littermate control MEFs, as judged by GFP expression or h-galactosidase activity after transfection with GFP expression plasmid or h-galactosidase expression plasmid, respectively (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 2C, basal NF-nB activity was similar among the SAC, GFP, and control MEFs. However, upon introduction of oncogenic Ras and c-Myc, the GFP and control MEFs, but not the SAC MEFs, showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in NF-nB activity (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that the SAC domain inhibited NF-nB activity induced by oncogenes.\n",

In contrast, wild-type MEFs cotransfected with oncogenic Ras and c-Myc in the presence of GFP did not undergo apoptosis (Fig. 2D). As expected, InB-SR suppressed NF-nB activity in the littermate control MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, inhibition of NF-nB activity induces apoptosis of the oncogene-expressing cells.\n",

The genotypes of the offspring from crosses of the SAC transgenic mice with TRAMP mice were confirmed by PCR genotyping (data not shown) to identify the SAC +/ /TRAMP +/ or GFP+/ /TRAMP+/ mice; SAC / /TRAMP+/ and SAC +/ /TRAMP / animals were used as littermate controls. Prostate tumor progression was studied by H&E staining of paraffin-fixed prostate sections. Histopathology of the mouse prostates indicated that by 3 months of age, the majority (62.5–83.3%) of the GFP +/ /TRAMP +/ and SAC / /TRAMP+/ control mice developed high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and 12% to 16% animals showed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Table 2; Fig. 4A, left).

In contrast, a majority (63–78%) of the prostates from GFP+/ /TRAMP+/ or SAC / /TRAMP +/ mice exceeded 6 g (Fig. 4B). Collectively, these data indicate the presence of the SAC domain transgene inhibits TRAMP tumor progression.\n",

      "Immunohistochemical analysis of the prostate sections indicated the GFP +/ /TRAMP +/ mice continued to express the GFP transgene in the PIN lesions and in adenocarcinoma of the prostate at 3 and 6 months of age (Fig. 4A, right). Conversely, the SAC +/ /TRAMP +/ mice expressed the SAC transgene in normal cells of the prostate, but showed a loss of SAC domain expression within the PIN lesions and in all of the adenocarcinoma sections (Fig. 4A, right). As expected, the SAC +/ /TRAMP / control mice continued to express the SAC transgene in the prostates at 3 or 6 months of age (Fig. 4A, right). These findings imply that expression of the SAC transgene must be down-modulated before adenocarcinoma development in the prostate. This observation was further substantiated by the finding that by age 12 months, 80% of the SAC +/ /TRAMP +/ mice developed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, the remaining 20% had only PIN lesions, and all tumors showed loss of SAC domain expression (data not shown).\n",

      "To confirm that the SAC domain could indeed prevent oncogenic transformation by inducing apoptosis in prostatic epithelial cells, we tested TRAMP-C1 cells derived from the TRAMP tumors (18), and immortalized prostate epithelial cells BPH-1 (19) for apoptosis by the SAC domain. Transfection with Par-4, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells but not normal or immortalized cells, was used as control. TRAMP-C1 cells are transformed because they express both SV40 large T and small t oncoproteins. The BPH-1 cells express stably integrated large T oncoprotein and are, therefore, immortalized; BPH-1 cells rarely show spontaneous transformation but can be induced to undergo transformation at high frequency by ectopic expression of the small t oncoprotein. As seen in Fig. 5B, TRAMP-C1 cells readily underwent apoptosis after transfection with either the SAC domain or Par-4, but not with the GFP control construct. On the contrary, BPH-1 cells failed to undergo apoptosis upon transfection with the SAC domain or the Par-4 construct (Fig. 5B).\n",

      "Interestingly, the BPH-1 cells readily underwent apoptosis upon cotransfection of the SAC domain and SV40 small t antigen (Fig. 5B). Conversely, both GFP and the SAC/155A mutant, which has a T to A mutation at the T155 residue (thus is not phosphorylated by PKA to become activated), failed to induce apoptosis in the presence of the small t antigen (Fig. 5B). From these data, we infer immortalized BPH-1 cells are resistant to apoptosis by the SAC domain, but coexpression of transforming small t oncoprotein renders them sensitive to apoptosis by the SAC domain. These findings imply that the SAC transgene may suppress the progression and growth of TRAMP tumors by inducing apoptosis.\n",

      "\n",
      "The findings of this study indicated that ubiquitous expression of the SAC domain of Par-4 is well tolerated in transgenic mice and does not interfere with the development, fertility, or life span of the animals. Most importantly, the physiologic levels of the SAC domain in the tissues are adequate to induce apoptosis and inhibit the development and progression of autochthonous tumors in the transgenic animals. Consistent with this observation, cells derived from the SAC transgenic mice grow normally in culture, but are resistant to oncogene-mediated cellular transformation. In fact, the SAC MEFs undergo apoptosis in the presence of oncogenes. These observations imply that the introduction of initiating lesions triggers the SAC domain to induce apoptosis and safeguard against transformation. The critical involvement of the SAC domain in preventing tumor growth in the transgenic mice was further reinforced by the finding that loss of SAC domain expression was associated with the ability of the SAC transgenic mice to produce autochthonous adenocarcinomas in the prostate. The SAC domain inhibits NF-nB DNA binding activity as judged by our electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). Inhibition of pro-cell survival NF-nB activity was identified as a mechanism underlying SAC domain–mediated apoptosis of oncogene-expressing cells. Thus, this study indicates the SAC domain is highly selective in inducing apoptosis to prevent transformation, as well as the subsequent development and progression of tumors in vivo. The SAC transgenic mouse is the first example of a cancer-resistant mouse that evades oncogene-mediated tumorigenesis by initiating apoptosis via the suppression of a defined pro-cell survival pathway. Par-4 is a tumor suppressor that is inactivated by mutation within the SAC domain (9), or by Akt1-mediated phosphorylation (11), or down-regulated (e.g., by hypermethylation) in human cancers (9, 10), and loss of Par-4 in knockout mice results in spontaneous tumors in diverse tissues (7). The SAC domain constitutes the effector domain for the Par-4 proapoptotic function (4, 6), and our present in vivo findings underscore the significance of the SAC domain in the tumor-suppressor function of Par-4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SAC domain is well tolerated and does not compromise fertility or life span in mice. Our previous studies had indicated that cancer cell lines, regardless of their sensitivity or resistance to Par-4, are usually sensitive to the apoptotic action of the SAC domain. On the other hand, normal or immortalized cell lines failed to undergo apoptosis with the SAC domain. Moreover, intratumoral injection of an adenovirus producing the SAC domain in s.c. tumor xenografts in nude mice caused rapid inhibition of tumor growth. In view of the limitations of the previous cell culture experiments, which tested apoptosis over a short-term period, and the fact that cell culture stress may differentially alter the response to apoptotic signals, we tested the tolerance and efficacy of the SAC module in animal models. Accordingly, transgenic mice that ubiquitously expressed the SAC transgene were generated to determine whether the mouse tissues tolerated the expression of the SAC transgene, and, importantly, whether at near-physiologic levels of in vivo expression the SAC domain maintained its apoptotic and tumor-suppressor potential. Moreover, due to the possibility that tumor suppressors may protect organisms from cancer early in life, but promote aging phenotypes, including late life cancer, in older organisms (20), we studied fertility and viability in the animals over their life span. Our studies indicated that the litter size and gender ratio were similar among the SAC and GFP transgenic mice, as well as the nontransgenic littermate control mice. The SAC transgenic mice developed and grew normally. The SAC and GFP transgenic mice maintained the corresponding transgene throughout their life span (data not shown), and the SAC transgenic mice lived a few months longer (P < 0.01) than the GFP transgenic mice or littermate control mice. The increase in survival observed in SAC transgenic mice may reflect the lower incidence of spontaneous tumors in these mice. However, the presence of tumors in older moribund mice does not necessarily imply that the tumors were the cause of death. Thus, fertility, viability, aging, and life span of the SAC transgenic mice were normal.\n",

In contrast, other mouse models in which p53 activity is aberrantly increased by amino-terminal protein truncation show tumor resistance but premature aging (27, 28). Thus, aberrant expression of a transgene may inversely affect suppression of tumor growth and aging (27, 28).

Several mechanisms, including inhibition of PKC by direct interaction with the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 (29) and nuclear inhibition of NF-nB transcription activity (16), have been proposed as the basis for Par-4 inhibition of NF-nB activity. However, recent studies indicate the leucine zipper domain of Par-4 is dispensable for its apoptotic action (4, 6, 30). Studies are currently under way to determine the mechanism by which NF-nB activity is inhibited by the SAC domain, which lacks the leucine zipper domain and primarily shows nuclear localization.\n",

We noted a high incidence of hepatocarcinomas in the liver and lymphomas in the spleen of aging GFP transgenic and littermate control mice, although none of the SAC transgenic mice showed tumors in the liver or spleen. This finding expands the range of the tumor tissues that may be targeted by the SAC domain to include hepatocarcinomas and hematopoietic tumors. As distinct pathways may be involved in the production of epithelial and hematopoietic tumors, this observation warrants further characterization of the tumors in the B6C3F1 mice and the precise mechanism of SAC-mediated tumor suppression. Importantly, several generations of the SAC transgenic mice were found to be similarly resistant to the growth of spontaneous tumors (data not shown), implying stable inheritance of the tumor-suppressor function of the SAC domain.\n",

      "SAC transgenic mice have increased resistance to prostate tumor growth. The TRAMP model provided the advantage of testing tumor suppression by the SAC domain in the absence of cellular p53 or Rb function, which is inhibited by the large T antigen of SV40. Our findings suggest the offspring expressing the SAC domain showed delayed development of PIN (high-grade PINs were more common in SAC /TRAMP + mice relative to SAC +/TRAMP + mice) and were resistant to the development of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Importantly, the tumors in all of the 21.4% SAC +/TRAMP + mice that progressed to adenocarcinoma (see Table 2) showed loss of SAC transgene expression. This finding implies that the SAC transgene functioned as a tumor suppressor in the prostate tissue, and that progression to advanced disease required loss of its tumor-suppressor function. The mechanism of tumor suppression by the SAC domain involved apoptosis of the cells within the PIN lesions of the SAC +/ /TRAMP + mice. Our parallel cell culture studies confirmed that SAC domain induces apoptosis of the TRAMP-C1 cells. The BPH-1 cells derived from benign prostatic hyperplasia are, on the other hand, resistant to apoptosis by the SAC domain, but can be rendered sensitive to SAC-mediated apoptosis by introduction of the small t antigen, which together with the large T antigen causes malignant transformation of the TRAMP tumors. The mechanism of apoptosis by the SAC domain involved inhibition of NF-nB activity, and studies with the I-nB-SR indicated that inhibition of NF-nB activity in the TRAMP cells was sufficient to induce apoptosis. Collectively, our cell culture and animal experiments imply that the SAC module induces apoptosis within the benign lesions to avert progression to adenocarcinoma by a p53- and Rb-independent pathway that involves inhibition of NF-nB activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SAC module is an archetype cancer therapeutic agent. The SAC domain, which circumvents inhibition by activated Akt (as it lacks the Akt-binding leucine zipper domain of Par-4; ref. 11), provides an ideal molecule for the therapy of cancer. Strikingly, the SAC domain exemplifies an archetypical anticancer therapeutic agent, as it is well tolerated in vivo, does not compromise the normal tissue function or life span of the host, and at physiologically innocuous levels is potent enough to induce tumor suppression via apoptosis. Thus, the findings of the present study with the SAC transgenic mice have translational significance for the development and analysis of cancer therapeutics.\n",
