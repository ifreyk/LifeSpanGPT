       "Rapamycin was found to increase (11% to 16%) the lifespan of male and female C57BL/6J mice most likely by reducing the increase in the hazard for mortality (i.e., the rate of aging) term in the Gompertz mortality analysis. To identify the pathways that could be responsible for rapamycin’s longevity effect, we analyzed the transcriptome of liver from 25-month-old male and female mice fed rapamycin starting at 4 months of age. Few changes (<300 transcripts) were observed in transcriptome of rapamycin-fed males; however, a large number of transcripts (>4,500) changed significantly in females. Using multidimensional scaling and heatmap analyses, the male mice fed rapamycin were found to segregate into two groups: one group that is almost identical to control males (Rapa-1) and a second group (Rapa-2) that shows a change in gene expression (>4,000 transcripts) with more than 60% of the genes shared with female mice fed Rapa. Using ingenuity pathway analysis, 13 pathways were significantly altered in both Rapa-2 males and rapamycin-fed females with mitochondrial function as the most significantly changed pathway. Our findings show that rapamycin has a major effect on the transcriptome and point to several pathways that would likely impact the longevity.\n",

       "\n",
       "Major advances in the biology of aging have been made over the past two decades due to several novel manipulations that were found to increase the lifespan of invertebrates and rodents. Up until 1996, the only manipulation consistently shown to increase lifespan in rodents was dietary restriction (DR). Because DR was also found to delay/reduce the incidence of most age-related diseases and pathology and to improve most physiological functions, it is generally accepted that DR increases lifespan by delaying aging [1]. In 1996, Brown-Borg et al. [2] reported the first genetic manipulation that increases the lifespan of a mammal; the Ames dwarf mice that have a mutation in Prop-1, which resulted in a deficiency in growth hormone leading to growth retardation. Subsequently, a number of genetic manipulations also have been shown to increase the lifespan of mice [3]. In 2009, Harrison et al. [4] reported that feeding mice rapamycin (Rapa) increased the lifespan of mice. This was a major discovery because it demonstrated that a pharmacological manipulation, which potentially could be translated to humans, increased lifespan and appeared to delay aging.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rapa, which is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus, inhibits the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway [5]. TOR is a serine/threonine kinase that is a regulatory nexus in response of eukaryotic cells to nutrients, growth factors, and energy status. TOR forms two major complexes in mammals, mTORC1 and# Rapamycin Alters the Transcriptome of Mice\n",
       "\n",
       "mTORC2. The components that make up the complexes are purchased from the National Institute of Aging (Baltimore, MD). similar, which includes mTOR, mLST8, Deptor, and TTI1/TEL2, with Raptor and PPRAS40 specific for mTORC1 and Rictor, mSIN1, and PPR5/Protor specific for mTORC2 [6]. mTORC1 plays a major role in regulating protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1. 4E-BP1 controls the cap-dependent translation of mRNA transcripts and S6K1 controls the phosphorylation of riboprotein S6, which is involved in the translation of mRNA transcripts to proteins [7]. In addition to Rapa’s well documented effect on cell growth and proliferation [8], decreased mTORC1 signaling is associated with increased autophagy, which could improve protein quality by removing damaged/misfolded proteins. Initially it was shown that Rapa’s inhibition was specific to mTORC1 and that mTORC2 was unaffected; however, recent studies suggest that chronic treatment of Rapa may also inhibit mTORC2 [9]. While the functions regulated by mTORC2 are not well known, reports in the literature suggest that mTORC2 has effects on the actin cytoskeleton, plays a role in insulin sensitivity, and regulates AKT signaling [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "Previous epistasis studies show that inhibition of TOR signaling by genetic manipulation or by feeding Rapa extends the lifespan of invertebrates [10]. The original observation by Harrison et al. [4] showed that Rapa extends lifespan of male and female UM-HET3 mice (generated from four inbred strains) fed Rapa starting at 19 months of age. Subsequently, Anisimov et al. [11] showed that Rapa given intermittently (2 weeks per month) increased the lifespan of female 129/Sv mice, and Miller et al. [12] showed that feeding male and female UM-HET3 mice Rapa starting at 9 months of age increased lifespan. More recently, Zhang et al. [13] reported that C57BL/6 mice fed Rapa starting from 19 months of age also extends lifespan; however, the increase in lifespan in this study was modest compared to that reported by Harrison et al. [4] in UM-HET3 mice. Thus, the effect of Rapa on the lifespan of mice is very robust, suggesting that mTOR signaling plays an important role in aging. Interestingly, DR and Ames dwarf mice, the two manipulations that consistently have been shown to increase lifespan also show a decrease in mTOR signaling [14].\n",
       "\n",
       "Although Rapa has been shown to alter cell growth/proliferation and autophagy through its inhibition of TOR, we have very little information on the mechanism(s) responsible for Rapa’s longevity phenotype. When autophagy genes are blocked in C. elegans, lifespan extension by TOR inhibition is prevented and lifespan reverts back to wild type [15]. In D. melanogaster, the lifespan extension observed when feeding Rapa is reverted back to control when S6K is overexpressed, 4E-BP1 is inhibited, or the autophagy gene Atg5 is reduced by RNAi [16]. It has also been shown that knocking out S6K1 (S6k1 is downstream of mTORC1) extends the lifespan of female but not male mice [17]. The goal of this study is to identify pathways/mechanisms by which Rapa extends lifespan in mice by comparing the effect of chronic Rapa treatment on the transcriptome of male and female mice. We show that feeding mice Rapa chronically, beginning at 4 months of age, increased lifespan 16% for females and 11% for males and resulted in major changes in the transcriptome that are associated with 13 pathways that are significantly altered by Rapa in both males and females.\n",

Two dietary regimens were used in this study: mice fed a commercial chow, LabDiet 5LG6-JL (LabDiet, St. Louis, MO), with Eudragit capsule (control) or 14 ppm encapsulated rapamycin (Rapa) in the food as described by Harrison et al. [4] from 4 months of age for the chronic Rapa study and from 19 months of age for the 6-months Rapa study. Mice in this study were fed the two diets ad libitum and maintained on a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle (6:00am/pm lights on/off). For the lifespan study, mice were started on Rapa or control diets at 4 months of age and maintained on these diets until the end of life. Otherwise, mice were maintained on 6-months or chronic dietary regiments until 25 months of age (6 and 21 months of treatment respectively). The mice were sacrificed at the same time of day (9:00 to 11:00am), i.e., the mice were not fasted before collecting the tissues. At which point tissues were collected. Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide and liver tissues collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until used. At the time of tissue collection, mice were healthy and free of disease as demonstrated by no major loss of weight and normal activity and appearance.

       "Using the distributions of ages at death, we tested among competing models for acceleration in the rate of increase in mortality based on the Gompertz family of models. The standard Gompertz model is in the form of u(x) = aebx, where u(x) is the instantaneous age-specific mortality. Model selection was based on a maximum-likelihood framework implemented in program WinModest [18]. Briefly, four models were considered: the two parameter Gompertz model (the standard Gompertz model), the Gompertz model with a constant additive age-independent term (Gompertz-Makeham model), the three parameter Logistic model (i.e., Gompertz with deceleration), and the Logistic-Makeham with an additive age-independent term. We used the least parameterized model, two-parameter Gompertz, because it provided the best fit for all mortality datasets [19] and the least parameterized model (two-parameter Gompertz) is recommended unless a more parameterized model has a significantly larger likelihood. Significance testing follows a standard method of comparing twice the difference between the likelihoods of the models being compared, which is distributed as chi-square with 1 degree of freedom. Thus, we examined two parameters from the Gompertz model that, together, describe aging dynamics within each treatment group. The first metric was the initial rate of mortality modeled beginning at age 4 months, denoted by the Gompertz parameter a. The second metric was the...# Rapamycin Alters the Transcriptome of Mice\n",

Approximately 100 ml of blood or 100 mg of liver samples and 0.1 mL of calibrator were mixed by sonification with 10 mL of 0.5 mg/mL ASCO and mixed with a solution containing 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate dissolved in 95% HPLC grade methanol. Supernatants, which were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 5 min at 23°C, were then injected into the LC/MS/MS. The ratio of the peak area of Rapa to that of the internal standard ASCO (response ratio) for each unknown sample was compared against a standard curve using different concentrations of Rapa standard.

       "In our lifespan study, male and female mice were given diets containing 14 ppm of rapamycin starting at four months of age. Figures S1 and S2 in File S1 show the body weights and food consumption over the lifespan of the four groups of mice. The mice fed Rapa showed a slightly lower body weight at some ages compared to controls; however, we observed no difference in food consumption. The data in Figure 1A, 1B, and Table S1 in File S1 show that Rapa significantly increased the lifespan of both male and female mice based on the Cox proportion hazard and Weibull’s survival analyses. Rapa increased the mean and median survival for females and the 10% survival for both males and females (Table S1 in File S1). The extension of lifespan was slightly greater in females than for the males fed Rapa. For example, when the entire survival curve was analyzed, Rapa was found to increase lifespan 16% in females compared to 11% in males (Figure 1A and 1B). The percent extension in lifespan was also greater in females vs. males for mean (14% vs. 7%) and maximum (19% vs. 8%) survival, and the Rapa-treated females were observed to have a significant increase in survival at earlier ages than males, e.g., 80% survival (Table S1 in File S1). Therefore, Rapa appears to have a greater and earlier effect on lifespan in female than male C57BL/6 mice. This is consistent with the reports using UM-HET3 mice [4,12]. We fit the distributions of the ages-at-death to the Gompertz family of models using maximum likelihood estimation [18]. From these initial models, the two-parameter Gompertz model provided the most parsimonious fit to the data for all sex and diet groups (Figure 1C and 1D, Table S3 in File S1). Because male and female mice did not differ from each other for the estimated Gompertz parameters when tested within each dietary treatment, we combined the sexes to increase the statistical power of the Rapa versus control comparison. We found that overall, Rapa significantly reduced mortality risk in the Gompertz whole model (p<1.61×10-26) by either reducing the initial mortality rate (at age 4 months), the rate of increasing mortality over the adult life span, or both. We observed no change in initial rate of mortality (p = 0.53); however, the rate of increase in the hazard for mortality, an indication of the rate of aging, approached significance (p = 0.06). Our mortality data is comparable to data reported by Miller et al. [12] for UM-HET3 mice.\n",

       "As a first approach into identifying genes and pathways that are altered by Rapa, we compared the liver transcriptome of male and female mice fed the control or Rapa diet, focusing on liver because it is the one of the first tissues to be exposed to Rapa, resulting in the liver being exposed to higher levels of Rapa relative to other tissues. Most important, liver expresses a large and diverse number of metabolic pathways, which allows us to view broadly the effects of Rapa. 25-month-old mice were studied to observe the chronic effect (21 months) of Rapa at a dose that increased lifespan before major changes occurred in survivorship or disease burden, which would complicate the interpretation of our transcriptome data. As shown in Table S2 in File S1, Rapa had no effect on the weight of liver or most tissues in 25-month-old males and females. We found that the levels of blood Rapa measured in 10-month-old males and females were significantly different, while the Rapa levels in the livers of males and females measured at 25-months were not significantly different (Figure 2A and 2B). Interestingly, we observed no difference in mTORC1 signaling in mice (either males or females) fed the control or Rapa diets for 21 months as measured by the ratio of phosphorylation of S6 to total S6.# Rapamycin Alters the Transcriptome of Mice\n",

Several other groups have reported that Rapa does not alter mTOR signaling when given chronically over a long period of time [21,22]. The lack of changes observed in the mTOR signaling by phosphorylated S6 to total S6 ratio could also be due to the lack of synchronization of the mice prior to sacrifice and the Rapa dose studied. We did observe that the TOR transcripts were significantly increased in both Rapa-2 males and Rapa-fed females. Sengupta et al. [23] observed a significant increase in S6 phosphorylation in the liver of mice with age when fasted, but no change when the mice were fed. On the other hand, our microarray data show changes in transcripts for mTORC2 signaling pathway, e.g., Rictor and Sgk1 are significantly down-regulated, while Akt shows no change in expression, and Pkc1a expression is increased. Our microarray data suggest that Pkc1a gene expression is up-regulated (in Rapa-2 male). These data are in agreement with Habib et al. [24], who found that sirolimus (rapamycin) activates PKC1a in endothelial cells. Based on our transcriptome data, it appears that the mTORC2 signaling pathway may be reduced because of the down-regulation of Rictor, which is needed in the formation of mTORC2, which agreed with previous data from Lamming et al. [9].\n",

       "We first used the multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS, Figure 3A) to compare the transcriptomes of male and female mice fed the two diets. MDS is an unbiased analysis that allows us to determine which of the four groups are similar and different. Using all the probes detected (25,697), we clearly observe gender differences in the transcriptome; the control-fed male and female mice form separate groups. In the females, the Rapa-fed mice appear as a group that is distinctly separate from the control-fed mice. In contrast, the Rapa males appear in two groups; 7 mice appear similar to the control males and 6 mice similar to the Rapa females. We observed no difference in body weight, body composition, and mTOR signaling between Rapa-1 males (the group similar to control males) and Rapa-2 males (the group that differs from control males). However, we did observe a difference in Rapa levels. Rapa-2 males had a significantly higher level of Rapa in the liver than Rapa-1 males (Figure 2B).

In Figure 5, we show the 13 pathways shared by Rapa-2 males and Rapa females, ranked by the lowest B-H p-value. We validated the changes in genes in the mitochondria function and estrogen signaling pathways using quantitative real-time PCR. In the mitochondrial function pathway, we show that transcripts for Glrx2 and Cox6A2 were down-regulated while Cyb5r3a and Cyc1 were up-regulated in Rapa-2 males and Rapa females (Figure S5A in File S1). In the estrogen receptor signaling pathway, Esr1, Sra1, and Kat2b were all down-regulated in Rapa-2 males and Rapa females similar to what was observed in the transcriptome analysis (Figure S5B in File S1). The expression of Stat3 and Pck1 (Figure S5C in File S1), which are genes downstream of the estrogen receptor signaling, are also down-regulated in both Rapa-2 males and Rapa females.\n",

       "Harrison et al. [4] were the first to show that rapamycin increased lifespan of UM-HET-3 mice when Rapa treatment was initiated at 19 months of age, e.g., a 9% and 14% increase in the lifespan of male and female mice, respectively. In a follow-up study, Miller et al. [12] showed a similar extension of lifespan in male and female UM-HET3 mice when Rapa feeding was initiated at 9 months of age. Interestingly, Zhang et al. [13] observed only a modest increase in lifespan of C57BL/6 mice when Rapa feeding was begun at 19 months of age. The lifespan of female mice increased only 6%, and Rapa had no significant effect on the lifespan of male mice. In this study, we show that Rapa treatment initiated at 4 months of age increased the lifespan of both male and female C57BL/6 mice to a level similar to that observed in UM-HET3 mice; lifespan was increased 11% for male and 16% for female C57BL/6 mice. Gompertz mortality analysis of our data suggest that the significantly decreased mortality hazards in Rapa-fed mice is due to a reduction in the rate of aging in the C57BL/6 mice, which is comparable to what Miller et al. [12] observed in UM-HET3 mice. In the studies with UM-HET3 and C57BL/6 mice, the Rapa dose (14 ppm) and diet composition were the same. Thus, C57BL/6 mice appear to require longer period of exposure to 14 ppm Rapa to show an increase in lifespan similar to that observed in UM-HET3 mice. We believe this difference in response to rapamycin most likely arises because levels of Rapa are much lower in the C57BL/6 compared to UM-HET3 mice. The blood levels of C57BL/6 mice fed 14 ppm Rapa in our study were 3–5 ng/ml compared to 13.4±2.6 [26] or 60–70 ng/ml [4] for UM-HET3 mice.

Twenty-four other pathways were observed to change significantly in Rapa-2 males: acute phase response signaling, hypoxia signaling, PI3K/AKT signaling, remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions, sertoli cell-sertoli cell junction signaling, renal cell carcinoma signaling, JAK/Stat signaling, IL-3 signaling, myc mediated apoptosis signaling, germ cell-sertoli cell junction signaling, pancreatic adenocarcinoma signaling, insulin receptor signaling, non-small cell lung cancer signaling, Rac signaling, small cell lung cancer signaling, PTEN signaling, prostate cancer signaling, neurotrophin/TRK signaling, PAK signaling, RAR activation, NGF signaling, clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling, huntington’s disease signaling, and TCA cycle II. Six other pathways were observed to change significantly in Rapa females: systemic lupus erythematosus signaling, mTOR signaling, actin nucleation by ARP-WASP complex, superpathway of methionine degradation, glutathione-mediated detoxification, and oncostatin M signaling.

Currently, there is little information about the effect of Rapa on mitochondria function in animals.

       "Protein ubiquitination, which signals specific proteins for degradation through the proteasome, appears to be decreased in chronically Rapa-fed mice, e.g. several ubiquitin-conjugating E2 transcripts such as Ube2a, Ube2d3, Ube2g1, Ube2q1 and ubiquitin-ligase E3A are decreased. Proteasome subunits such as Psmc1, Psmd1, Psmd10, Psmd14, Psme7, and Psme9 are also decreased in Rapa-2 males and females. In 6-months Rapa females, ubiquitin-conjugating E2 transcript Ube2j1 and proteasome subunits Psmb10, Psmb5, Psmb7, Psmc6, Psmd6, Psmc7, Psmd11, Psmd12, and Psmd14 are decreased suggesting a decrease in protein ubiquitination as well. Zhang et al. [13] reported that proteasome activity was reduced in liver as well as other tissues in 19-month old female mice fed Rapa for 6 months. They also observed that the decrease in proteasome activity was paralleled by increased autophagy, suggesting Rapa treatment shifts protein degradation from the proteasome pathway to the autophagy pathway. It has been shown previously that protein degradation through the proteasome and autophagy pathways is coordinated in a way that changes in one pathway are countered by changes in the opposite direction in the other pathway, e.g., the chronic inhibition of proteasome are paralleled by increased autophagy [36].\n",

       "The up-regulation of the NRF2 pathway is believed to be in extending lifespan and delaying aging. For example, NRF2 has been suggested to partially be responsible for the increased resistance to oxidative stress observed in DR mice [37]. In addition, overexpression of skn-1, the Nrf1/2/3 homolog in C. elegans, extends lifespan and increase stress resistance [38]. Changes in the levels of several transcripts in the NRF2 signaling pathway suggest that this pathway is reduced in chronically fed Rapa-2 males and females. First, Nrf2 transcripts are decreased, and the transcript level of Keap1, the inhibitor of Nrf2, are increased. Second, the anti-oxidative responsive genes regulated by NRF2 are down-regulated (Gst, Sod2, Cat, Fth1, and Prdx1 transcript levels are significantly reduced). Also, the levels of the transcript for Gclm, which is the rate limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis, is reduced in the mice fed Rapa. A reduction in NRF2 signaling would be predicted to result in tissues/cells becoming more sensitive to a variety of environmental stresses. Our preliminary data show that primarily cultures of mouse fibroblasts pre-treated with Rapa are more sensitive to a variety of stresses, e.g., hypochlorous acid, paraquat, and t-butyl hydroperoxide (Figure S7 in File S1).\n",

       "The identification that the IGF-1 signaling pathway as one of the pathways significantly altered by Rapa is interesting because research over the past decade points to Igf-1 being important in aging, e.g., circulating IGF-1 levels are reduced by DR, mutations in daf2, the homolog of Igf-1 in C. elegans, increase lifespan [39] and female mice deficient in the IGF-1 receptor show increased lifespan [40]. Igf-1 transcript is increased in both Rapa-2 males and Rapa females, suggesting that Rapa treatment induces IGF-1 synthesis by the liver, which is the tissue responsible for the production of circulating levels of IGF-1. Igf binding protein-1, which binds IGF-1 maintaining it in an inactive state [41], transcripts are decreased significantly in Rapa-2 males and decreased in Rapa females but not significantly. Igf binding protein 7, which also binds with a higher affinity to insulin, transcripts are decreased in both Rapa-2 males and Rapa females. Thus, our data suggest that circulating levels of IGF-1 accessible to other tissues is higher in the mice fed Rapa. While an increase in IGF-1 signaling may not be comparable to what has been observed with DR and mutants in Igf-1/Igf-1-receptor, increased IGF-1 signaling could have a positive effect on the aging brain because IGF-1 has been shown to improve brain synaptic structure, plasticity, and functions [42].\n",

       "Two of the six pathways potentially involved in aging are related to protein synthesis: eIF2 signaling and the regulation of eIF4 & p70S6K signaling. The eIF2 and eIF4 & p70S6K signaling pathways overlap and play a major role in the regulation of translation. One would expect the eIF2 and eIF4 & p70S6K signaling pathways to be reduced in liver tissue of our mice treated with Rapa because mTOR, which regulates translation, is# Rapamycin Alters the Transcriptome of Mice\n",

       "inhibited by Rapa. We observe a significant reduction in the transcript levels of a number of ribosomal proteins in the 60S (Rpl4, Rpl23, Rpl39, Rpl27a, and Rpl7) and 40S (Rps3 and Rps3a) ribosome subunits in Rapa-2 males and Rapa females. A similar effect was also observed in 6-months Rapa treated females, which is consistent with previous reports that reduced mTOR signaling decreases ribosome biogenesis [43]. We also observed changes in the levels of transcripts for proteins that regulate the initiation of protein synthesis. For example, the transcript levels of Eif3, which activates initiation by facilitating the initial binding of the 40S ribosome subunit to mRNA, was significantly reduced; while the transcript for Eif2b, which facilitates the binding of tRNA and the 60S ribosome to the 40S initiation complex, was increased significantly in Rapa-2 males and Rapa females.\n",
       "\n",
       "A decrease in the overall rate of protein synthesis by Rapa could be important in translation fidelity and protein quality. Conn and Qian [44] recently reported that activation of mTOR activity by Rheb led to an increased rate of ribosomal translation and reduced translation fidelity, while inhibition of mTOR by Rapa restored translation fidelity by reducing the rate of ribosome translation of mRNA [45]. Our observation that Rapa alters eIF2 signaling and the regulation of eIF4 & p70S6K signaling pathways are consistent with the suggestion by Kaeberlein and Kennedy [46] that reduction of global mRNA translation and increase in selective transcripts may be beneficial in aging, and Selman et al. [17] reported that null mutation in the S6k1 gene increases the lifespan of female, but not male mice. It is also interesting to note that Rapa did not extend the lifespan of Drosophila that express a constitutively active form of S6K1 or in Drosophila null in 4E-BP1 [16], indicating that down-regulation of protein synthesis may be important in the lifespan extension effects of Rapa in Drosophila. Therefore, the alterations we have observed in the eIF2 signaling and the regulation of eIF4 & p70S6K signaling pathways could potentially contribute to the life-extending actions of Rapa.\n",
       "\n",
       "One interesting observation from our study was that ERK signaling was common to 10 of the 13 IPA pathways found to be shared in Rapa-2 males and Rapa females. Based on the increase in the transcripts for c-Raf and Erk1/2 in Rapa-2 males and for c-Raf, Mek1/2, and Erk in the Rapa females, it would appear that ERK signaling is increased in the Rapa treated mice and that this increase might be important in the changes we observe in some of these pathways. For example, chronic activation of ERK signaling has been shown to down-regulate the NRF2 pathway [47]. Also, glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit ERK signaling and because the glucocorticoid receptor signaling is down-regulated by Rapa, this could be a potential reason in the increase in ERK signaling [48]. ERK signaling may be increased to counteract the decrease in protein synthesis by Rapa, which is known to decrease protein synthesis, because ERK signaling has been shown to regulate ribosome biogenesis [49] and S6k1 [50].\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, our study provides the first insight into the potential mechanisms of Rapa’s life-extending mechanisms. We identified several pathways, which would have been predicted from what is known about rapamycin’s mode of action, e.g., alterations in pathways involved in protein synthesis and turnover. Our data suggest that Rapa improves protein quality by reducing protein synthesis and shifting protein degradation to autophagy. Improved protein quality has been proposed to play a major role in aging [51,52]. On the other hand, the alterations we observed in the apparent reduction in pathways involved in protecting cells/tissues from stress (NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response), as well as reduced levels of transcripts for several antioxidant enzymes, were surprising and suggest that animals fed Rapa are more sensitive to stress, including oxidative stress. Research over the past two decades has shown that almost all manipulations that increase lifespan show increased resistance to stress, e.g., DR, dwarf mouse models, and the many long-lived mutants of C. elegans [53]. If future studies confirm our pathway analysis of the transcriptome and show that tissues/cells from mice fed Rapa are more sensitive, or even have no change in sensitivity to stress, Rapa would be one of the few manipulations that increase lifespan without a corresponding increase in stress resistance, suggesting that combining Rapa with other manipulations might extend lifespan further. Finally, we were surprised to find that the pathway most robustly affected by Rapa was mitochondrial function. While mitochondrial function has long been viewed as important in aging, there is currently little evidence that Rapa alters mitochondria function. Our transcriptome data indicate that a more intensive study of the effect of Rapa/mTOR on mitochondrial function is needed.\n",
